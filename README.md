##Dog Health API



The goal of this project is to create a test API using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL

The API endpoints created so far are:
/user/add
/user/editPassword
/user/login
/user/delete

/dog/add
/dog/edit
/dog/delete
/dog/getDogsByUsername

Things which still need to be done:

1. Login system should be implemented to use some sort of secure token, not just username
2. Clean up query for dog edit - why error out if I don't get user
